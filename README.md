# About my first project on GitHub.
# The data of this project was gotten from mavenanalytics, and it analyses motorvehicles that were stolen over the years, indicating the most stolen vehicle, regions with the most stolen vehicle and regions with the least, most stolen vehicle type and make, day of the week when vehicles are most stolen.
# It gives a total of vehicles stolen, total vehicle type, regions were the theft took place.[motor vehicle theft project.xlsx](https://github.com/Kofoworola14/my-first-project/files/15178316/motor.vehicle.theft.project.xlsx)
# Steps taken during the analysis;
After going through the maven analytics playground, the motor vehicle theft data on the playground caught my attention and I decided to analyze it using Microsoft Excel.
After using power query editor to clean up the data, I created pivot tables and charts from the data.
I was able to create nine pivot charts from the data which were the; Top five stolen vehicle type, Bottom five stolen vehicle type, Make type of stolen vehicles, Total vehicles stolen by day of the week, Top five regions with the most theft, Bottom five regions with the least theft, Stolen vehicle trend, Total vehicles stolen by model year and Top ten vehicles stolen by make.
I analyzed the top five stolen vehicle type, bottom five stolen vehicle type, top five regions with the most theft, bottom five regions with the least theft and top ten vehicles stolen by make, using bar charts, as they gave really good representations of the data.
I analyzed the make type of stolen vehicles using a doughnut chart, as they were just two vehicle types.
I analyzed the total vehicles stolen by day of the week, stolen vehicle trend, total vehicles stolen by model year using a line chart.
I created the slicers from the pivot charts to report connections between the slicers and the charts.
I then created a dashboard for my analysis by cutting each chart from the excel sheet and pasting on the dashboard and also doing the same with the slicers.
From the power pivot, I was able to calculate the total vehicle stolen, the average age of the vehicle stolen, the region count, the total vehicle type and was also able to identify the most stolen vehicle.
I then gave an insight of my analysis.
